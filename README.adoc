= OpenAPI Diff Tool Gradle Plugin

== Introduction
The
https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-diff[OpenAPI Diff Tool] is useful in comparing 2 specifications. As part of the original repository a maven plugin is included but for those of us that prefer Gradle there was no plugin to be found. This repository contains the code to implement such a plugin.


The plugin has been implemented with an Extention, allowing for teh configuration options to be passed in a block assigned with "openapi_diff", and can be used in the build.gradle file

[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
    id 'com.x3t.gradle.plugins.openapi.openapi_diff'
}

openapi_diff {
    oldFile = "old_specification.yaml"
    newFile = "new_specification.yaml"
}
----

The functionality can also be used by creating a task in the build.gradle similar to

[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
    id 'com.x3t.gradle.plugins.openapi.openapi_diff'
}

task triggerCompatible(type: com.x3t.gradle.plugins.openapi.OpenapiDiffPluginTask){
    oldFile = "old_specification.yaml"
    newFile = "new_specification.yaml"
}
----
